## Process connecting the frontend and backend

* It is good practice to have the frontend and backend in separate python files.
* For best use it makes sense to make the backend as a class so that you can import it and call the functions as button presses on the frontend.
* I did not program my backend with this in mind so I am going to have to reprogram it
* Needs to be reprogrammed anyway as it was designed as if it was a standalone app so there's opened windows that go against my frontend design.
* Webcam is open already on the app so rather than getting another webcam recording its best to pull from the same source, so this will require reprogramming of both my backend and frontend.
