## Frontend Update

Frontend up until this point was just simple buttons and labels. Now the frontend has been updated with frames and colors. Labels background made transparent. It now resembles more like the Krita designs. I asked some peers whether to leave the buttons as rounded or have them be round images and unaminously they decided it looked more appealing rounded.

### Hotkeys
Hotkeys were also implemented. Originally it was 'r' for recording and space for capturing frames. I had to change the recording hotkey to "Ctrl-R" instead as it would start recording when 'r' was pressed while typing the sprite name. Spacebar can be left as the entry box is disabled while recording anyway and captures can only be doen during recording.

### To Do:
* Test model with new footage from participants
* Continue write-up
* Implement additional features
