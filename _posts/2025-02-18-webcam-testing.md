## Webcam tests
Now that I have webcams to use I need to utilise the different ones to create example footage to use for testing.<br/>
I spent some time striking different poses in different outfits in order to test how the different models work. These were as both frames and videos.

### Setup
I created two python files to take pictures and videos of me respectively to save locally.<br/> I also knew I wanted to use MediaPipe's pose landmarker so I downloaded the necessary files for this. Will report how these tests go tomorrow.

### To Do:
* Continue testing different background removal models
* Test MediaPipe's Pose Landmarker
* Finish work on demonstration
