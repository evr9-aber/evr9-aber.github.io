## Demo Self Reflection

Had the Mid Project Demo today. So here is a quick self evaluation.

### What Went Well

* Remembered scripted opening well
* Able to show off all features
* While not perfect, the demo showed the process start to end to what will be roughly in the final version
* Able to talk about future plans
* Able to talk about what I am working on now, and UI for future
* Talked about other possibilities for final project if everything goes well
* Talked about ethical concerns with uploading faces and how I plan to mitigate it
* Had marker pose for the project and it work
* Had fun while doing the demo
* Explained my code and how it functioned
* Able to answer marker's questions

### What Could Have Gone Better

* There was someone else in the room doing their demo midway through mine and it made it hard to concentrate
* Got caught on words a few times
* USB Camera took longer than usual to start up for recording
* Exiting the app with the q key required several attempts
* Went over time by accident

### Am I Happy with how it went?

Yes I am happy with how it went, I got to talk about my code to someone familiar with the topic of Computer Vision and able to explain well how my project worked and the future plans. They seemed very happy with my progress and said they were excited to see what it will be for the final demonstration. Minimal feedback as they were quite happy with my outlined future plans with the UI, ethical censorship and allowing inanimate objects.
