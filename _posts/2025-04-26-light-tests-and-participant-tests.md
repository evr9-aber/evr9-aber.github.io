## Light Tests and Participant Tests

### Lighting Tests

Inspired by Computer Vision: A Modern Approach by Forsyth Ponce, I recorded and ran tests based on different lighting colours. Using LED lights as my only source of lighting (except for some monitor glare), I tested how the pose detector reacts with white, red, blue, and green lighting.

### Participant Tests

Using the videos that were sent in by participants, I ran tests and ranked my pose detection and background removal.
