## Detect when Subject hits a pose
For the next demonstration, I wanted to be able to take multiple frames as multiple costumes in a Scratch sprite. I implemented that over the weekend but that was a button function, I instead want the photos taken automatically by detecting if the subject in the video is holding still to strike a pose.

### Motion detection model testing
After discussion with Hannah Dee, my approach for detecting motion stopping, is to use background subtraction to see when the foreground (the person) becomes the background by being still for long enough.

#### KNN and MoG Background Subtraction
The model I currently use for KNN, cv.createBackgroundSubtractorKNN(), causes the foreground mask to fade when I stand still. However, the foreground mask still tracks point of interest on me that cause me not to entirely fade, no matter how much I stand still. MoG has a similar problem but fades more much faster. Comparing the models with the same footage exposed an issue with both of them, this is light fluxtuation. While recording myself, there was a video playing on my computer monitor and thus when something bright happened on my screen, my face would receive more light. This is an issue that future versions of my application should keep in mind while I'm making tweaks to my computer vision models.

### Adding it to application
Taking MoG, I used the mask generated by it and analysed the percent of black pixels in the mask. Once that reached a threshold, I decided that the subject had been still long enough to fade into the background and thus capture the frame. I update text saying it is "Capturing" and, if the subject does not move within that second, it captures then enters a cooldown state of 3 seconds to allow for the subject to start moving again to the next pose. At the moment 98% seems to be a good threshold but I highly doubt that will persist till the end of the topic (likely having a set threshold is not the way to go about this). It can now, until told to stop, take frames whenever the subject stands still to strike a pose then
