## Made first design

Made first design for the front end of app, will show on Monday for feedback.

### Design Choices

The first draft of design can be seen [here](https://evr9-aber.github.io/docs/First_Draft_Annotated.pdf) with small annotations to explain choices and intended function.

* Colours to mimic Scratch app main colours (orange, blue, off-white). Does not seem to be copyrighted so should be fine (can't use logo or characters though).
* Input box for sprite name (if invalid turn box red and have text underneath saying there's a problem)
* Folder icon to search for Scratch file path.
* Camera icon for taking individual screenshots (greyed out until recording starts). Space bar will also do this.
* Record button to start recording and start up the pose detection. When pressed, icon becomes square to indicate it is now to stop recording. R key will start and stop also. REC added due to feedback from my mum who is a teacher.
* Webcam always running while app open to minimise webcam start up time as it can start up in the background.
* Text on side tells status of recording (might also put instructions over there also)

### To Do:
* Develop frontend.
* Redesign backend to match up with frontend buttons and use.
* Connect backend to frontend.
* Run tests on friends' footage when received.
* Continue write-up.
