## Test Data Recording
I spent today going around various locations and striking various poses, in order to test how my application reacts to less ideal settings. This is so, when tweaking my computer vision models, I have references I can consistently test against. These include: against a wall outside, in an open area, with the sea behind me, and with plants being blown by the wind.<br/>
This being outside, my laptop was being blown by the wind during some recordings, so this can help testing against small vibrations in the camera. Realistically, not all recordings are going to be steady and we don't want to make it impossible for these people to be able to use the application.<br/>
I recorded these videos once with my arms and legs exposed, and once where they are covered by my clothes, to provide further variation within my test data.

### To Do:
* Record videos of possible non-human subjects that students would like to use.
* Create second mode to allow users to not use human pose segmentation but instead use background removal for inanimate objects that students may also want to use as sprites.
* Once ethics form comes back, request videos from people I know to use as test data.
* Create a test sheet to define what success is for the test videos.
