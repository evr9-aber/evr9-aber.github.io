## New Feature: Select Frames

As it is right now, all frames taken gets processed. Now I have implemented a pop up window that, once you finish recording, gives you a slideshow of captured frames that can be excluded by unchecking a checkbox below the image. So now you can pick and choose which captured frames get processed into your sprite. Want to also use this screen to allow users to select whether they want their face blurred. Still needs some tweeks to the look of this new UI and need to fully bug test but this is a good new feature.

### To Do:
* Add blur button
* Bug test new feature
* Test model with new footage from participants
* Continue write-up
