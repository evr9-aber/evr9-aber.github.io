## Device and Language Choice

### Device: Tablet vs Laptop.

Most schools will have access to either tablets or laptops so this should be the focus of the device decision.

#### Tablet Pros:
* Touchscreen is intuitive
* As children have less access to computers, it would function similar to their phones which they are more intimate with
* Portable

#### Tablet Cons:
* Not steady (need a static background which is more difficult to film with a tablet)
* I personally have little experience coding for touchscreen
* I have no personal experience with Scratch Jr
* If users want to port it to their desktop it requires student to have knowledge on how to upload output to computer which gets in the way of them Scratch programming and adds extra steps for the teacher to worry about.

#### Laptop Pros:
* Easier to take steady videos with camera as you can set it down without need of case or other equipment
* I have more experience coding for computers
* I have used the desktop version of Scratch
* Easier to manage files and output
* Less steps for file transfer
* Can utilise USB camera
* Could perhaps utilize Scratch API (need to look further)

#### Laptop Cons:
* Not as many students have computer experience
* More expensive equipment for schools
* Not as portable
* Not as intuitive as touchscreen

#### Conclusion
Due to their steady camera, function in average classroom, and my own personal experience using them, I am choosing to develop for a laptop.

### Language
I have experience with Computer Vision already with Python (in particular OpenCV and Spyder). I have experience with websites with Python and C. I have worked on satellite images in Python and C.<br/>
Java is worth considering as I have experience working with Java for apps.<br/>
My moderator is most familiar with Python.<br/>

#### Conclusion
Python is the obvious choice due to my ease of access for Computer Vision resources for Python as the module's workshop (CS34110) was conducted in it, and my moderator is familiar with it. Also due to my previous experience while working in my Industrial Year working with satellite images in Python.
