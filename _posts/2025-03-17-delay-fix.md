## Lag Mitigated and Flow Diagram

Added code to run the mediapipe model every 5 loops rather than every loop which has finally gotten the delay down from 5 seconds down to about 3 seconds. This is a level of delay from hitting pose to capture that I think is acceptable and it seems to do this consistently. It also has meant that feeding video into the model does not fall over like it used to. It still slows down while running a pre-recorded video but it should be at the very least test ready. I plan to implement a video buffer to try and further reduce this slow running but it should still be good for testing the model.

### Flow Diagram

Drafted a flow diagram for the user experience of the product. Currently it is for one user, does not take into account if other person presses the capture button during video. Will perhaps add later. As I design the frontend, it is likely to develop further.

### To Do:

* Write up forms for people testing as outlined in my ethics
* Experiment with test footage to create new test sheet
* Tweak model if necessary
