## Write Up Progress

Significant progress made writing up all the sections except for critical evaluation. Background, Analysis & Process; Design; Implementation; Testing all have had all but the end stages of their sections are mostly finished. This is because these parts have not yet been completed within the actual project which is what this weekend will be spent designing, implementing and testing. The visual design needs to be completely realised within Tkinter and feedback needs to be gathered. The participant test footage have been received and need to tested against. While reading, I realised different colour lighting tests would be useful and these need to be recorded and tested. The extra features previously discussed still require implementation.

## To Do:
* Clean up frontend design
* Test model with new footage from participants
* Continue write-up
* Implement additional features
