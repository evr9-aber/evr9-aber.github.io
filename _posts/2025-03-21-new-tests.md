## New Tests

Since finally getting my model working I need to redo my tests. This has proved good things and bad things. The good news is that because it is focused on just the person, its size in frame does not have nearly as big of an impact and thus test videos like the landscape no longer take constant frames. The bad news is that it has exposed that my size in frame had more to do with why it was capturing than I realised. It takes longer to recognise stillness, not because the model is worse but because it is more focused. Simply put, I am not holding the pose long enough in my test footage and the fact that there was stillness captured before, was actually a problem that so happened to work. I have concluded that 3.5 seconds is a fair amount of time for a pose to be struck to be recognised as stillness. But within most my videos, I am striking it for about 1.5 seconds, which is not long enough. Meaning for a test of how I now want this to function pose detection-wise, I need to go out and rerecord a bunch of my footage. This time with a better plan though.<br/>

Note: Plant footage still has issue detecting poses, even when standing in pose for long enough.

### To Do:
* Rerecord test footage
* Experiment with test footage to create new test sheets for the old model and new model
* Tweak new model if necessary
* Write up forms for people testing as outlined in my ethics
