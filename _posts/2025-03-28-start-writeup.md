## Started Write-Up

Started write-up for the project. Set up LaTeX file to get general formatting. Made outline of general sections and subsections I plan to write. Made title page, contents page, bibliography, acknowledgements, addendum. Began notes for write-up to be expanded upon.

### Sent out messages for other people to help testing

Sent messages and consent form to friends to get their videos for me to test my model against. Awaiting their responses.

### To Do:

* Run tests on sent videos
* Make front end design
* Continue write-up
