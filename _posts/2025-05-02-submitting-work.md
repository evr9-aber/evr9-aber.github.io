## Submitting Work

Last night, I finished and submitted my project written report and technical work.

This morning I improved it to the best I felt I can do. Now I have to hope it all went well.

### Menu Bar

I also implemented and wrote up about a new feature, the menu bar. This extension feature handles simple commands like copy, open file, close. Helps make the tkinter look more professional. The hardest part to implement was the ability to switch cameras. The back end always had opportunity to use either the main or USB camera but the app with frontend had no option. So I implemented one. This was tricky as there will already be a camera feed and recursive "after" function. To implement this, I put the function to a variable, this variable can then be stopped when I want to call a new webcam feed.

### To Do:
* Final Demonstration
