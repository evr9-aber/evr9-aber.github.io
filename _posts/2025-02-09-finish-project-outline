## Finishing Project Outline

The feedback for the project outline was very positive so I felt only minor changes were needed. This included grammar checks, name changes and adding more steps to the development proposed task.

### Initial Annotated Bibliography

I needed to add an bibliography of any reading I had done. This included documentation I read for the software and systems I plan to use, as well as some Computer Vision reading from the Reading List. I added until I ran out of space and submitted my work.

### To Do
* Begin work on application now that all the prerequisites (reading, choosing tools, setting up Github and Blog) have been completed.
* See if I can get USB camera
* Draw plan for GUI
