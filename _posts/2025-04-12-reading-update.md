## Write-Up Progress and Reading

Began first draft of the write-up. Have finished the first section on Background though will definitely return to improve it (especially the Process section). Have written about the process of early stages of implementation and code development.

### Reading

To get an idea of writing style and to brush up on Computer Vision theory I have begun reading published work. Finished reading a published work I briefly looked at before - David Marr's Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information. Helped me brush up on some forgotten theory and delve deeper into insights and techniques that I, in the current day, likely take for granted. (Strange speeling mistakes throughout, must have had some problems scanning in the book)

### To Do:

* Clean up frontend design
* Test model with new footage from participants
* Continue write-up
