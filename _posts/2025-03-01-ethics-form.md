## Project Description

The 'Make Me a Sprite' project will develop a desktop application to allow students to create sprites of themselves to import into their own projects for the computer programming language Scratch. It will record a video of them with a camera, select key frames, and remove the background to import the images into Scratch.<br/>

This project will automate a process of creating sprites by allowing for the user to hold a series of poses, then the program will detect and capture frames from when those poses are struck, to then be processed, backgrounds removed, formatted and resized then put into a Scratch project as a sprite with multiple “costumes”.<br/>

Utilising computer vision principles, such as static background removal and pose detection, the project will eliminate the need of green screens, or other matte backgrounds, in order to easily remove the background from frames. This is for ease of setup in a classroom setting that may not have the luxury of a blank wall for this purpose. It will be able to use any static background.

## Ethical Issues

I have ticked the box for “Working with people”. This project requires people to record videos of themselves which raises two potential issues with the project’s development and goals: this project is aimed at children and testing requires multiple videos of people.

### Aimed at children

Scratch used to have a built-in camera for the purpose of taking a picture for use as a sprite. Though it was not as robust as the specifications of this project, the idea of letting people use themselves as sprites for ease of development was something once a feature of the software. However, the Scratch team have since removed this feature, as announced in their forums back in May 2021. This was done due to concerns of encouraging people to share pictures of themselves online. With this in mind, there are concerns that this project will do exactly that.<br/>

The project’s goals were created with the use in mind being within a classroom setting and not to be shared online, but Scratch encourages upload of your projects and a lot of classes will often want the students to upload their work. The students may also be wearing uniforms or other identifying features that should not be encouraged to be uploaded online for others to see. This can be worked around by allowing for the use of facial and symbol blurring so that the students can still use themselves to strike poses for Sprites, without the safety risk of uploading their face and uniform.

### Testing

The project utilises pose detection and background removal for its image processing. This must work on all body types on most backgrounds. I am only one person and so can only test against a few different backgrounds and, at best, different clothing choices. To ensure my application is accessible it must be tested with a variety of body shapes, skin tones, genders, outfits, hairstyles and hair colours. This will require working with other people and using videos of them for testing and development. This will require a consent form, and I must handle what they share with me with care.<br/>

Part of demonstrating this project will likely require me to show this functionality with multiple people, this will require their consent to show their videos and the application’s subsequent output. I do not necessarily need all of them to show off functionality but I should at least show that it works on people other than myself. So even if they consent to having their videos used for testing, I will allow them to separately rescind their consent for being used in demonstrations.
